#### **6. Practice Assignments**

**Task 1: Create a "CodingGita Students" database**

Create a new MongoDB database called `CodingGita`. Add two collections:
- `students`: Name, roll number, department, year, courses enrolled.
- `courses`: Course code, name, credits, instructor.

Insert sample data into both collections.

**Task 2: Perform CRUD operations**
- Add a few more students and courses to the database.
- Query data based on:
  - Department (e.g., "Computer Science").
  - Year (e.g., "2").
  - Courses enrolled (e.g., "CS101").
- Update the courses for a specific student (e.g., adding a new course).
- Delete a student or course from the database.
